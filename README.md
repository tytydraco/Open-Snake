# Open Snake
An open source Snake game written in Unity, designed to be hacked!

# Details
The game is bare bones, with just the basic mechanics and controls implemented. It is compatible with both keyboard (WASD) and touchscreen devices.

# Modding
The purpose of Open Snake is to be modded! Since it's so bare bones, you can experiment with ideas to make the game of Snake just a bit more fun. Here's some ideas to get you started:

- The game gets increasingly faster as the snake eats more food
- Food will increase your snake's length exponentially instead of linearly
- Additional food types, such as a super food that gives your snake three more tail pieces
- Food that keeps moving every five seconds if the player doesn't reach it quickly enough
